For my slide show [*Transasia – Mit dem Motorrad von Meidling nach Malaysia*](http://transasia.mgrubinger.at/) I needed an interactive way to visualize the route I traveled through asia. I built this [little web app](https://28771km.grooovinger.com/), where I can control the drawing of my route simply by scrolling. 

The plot: for **one scrolled pixel**, you **travel for one kilometer**. Thus the name ["28771 kilometers"](https://28771km.grooovinger.com/) as this is the total length of the trip.

Additionally I needed a way to zoom in to specific areas/countries as I speak, so a quick, reliable and most of all invisible (for the audience) UI was needed. Inspired by one of [Marcin Wicharys](https://twitter.com/mwichary) talks, I implemented an "invisible UI":

Start typing the first letters of a country along the route to zoom in and fit the country into the viewport (also jumps the head of the route to the border). For example: "IRA" for Iran, "MAL" for Malaysia.

This is in no way a finished product but it served me well during my presentations and was fun to build.
