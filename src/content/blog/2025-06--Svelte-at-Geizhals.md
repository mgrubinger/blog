Yesterday I had the honor to present my talk "Svelte at Geizhals" at the Svelte Vienna Meetup. This was my first meetup talk ever, and I was a bit nervous â€“Â but the hosts made sure I felt welcome and supported me very well! Thank you, Ermin and JYC!

Here is the link to my slides: [Svelte at Geizhals Slides](/talks/Svelte-at-Geizhals.pdf)

The feedback I received after the talk was very good, and I had a lot of interesting conversations afterwards. I'm happy I could finally contribute back by giving a talk, after visiting the Svelte Vienna meetup many times in the past.

_edit_: You can watch the recording my my talk on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJVdfPk9WmI

Notes from other talks:

## ZeeltePHP (Svelte + PHP)

Harry set out to bridge the gap between PHP and SvelteKit and builds [ZeeltePHP](https://github.com/derharry/svelte-zeeltephp) for that. Very engaging talk with lots of live coding (props to Harry for that!) â€“Â the crowd was also very supportive in spoting unsaved files and other typos along the way ðŸ™‚

## Adding full to your full-stack sveltekit app

[Jean-Yves](https://jyc.dev/blog) did another great talk about [Remult](https://remult.dev). They just launched v3 and a stunning new landing page and docs. Great work on that, Remult team!

The talk itself left me speachless â€“ I think I deliberatly had to close my mouth during that talk because to not look like this: ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®

Jean-Yves delivered a super fun and engaging talk about a tool I never really looked into so far.

Remult looks like a very cool project. They really did think about so many use-cases, and made the whole system very flexible and customizable. Strong Meteor.js vibes, but 10Ã— more awesome! The fact that they support so many Meta-Frameworks and database combinations is just ðŸ’¯

I really felt inspired to try it out on one of my side projects.

Side note: Recently, I was wondering why there are not more frameworks utilizing [SSE (Server-Sent Events)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) for progressively updating the DOM from the server. And now here's Remult doing just that with their [LiveQuery feature](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_livequery). Very exciting.

## Svelte Vienna

As usual, I had a great time at the Svelte Vienna meetup. The folks who showed up yesterday made me feel welcome as a first-time speaker, with many faces in the audience nodding along as a sign of support. Highly appreciated!

Svelte Vienna also has a new domain now: [svelte.at](https://www.svelte.at)

Thanks for organizing, and thanks for hosting to [Lean Coders](https://www.lean-coders.at) and Ahead of Time Software (no website yet?).
