There's a new CSS property landing in Chrome 123 that will automatically resize textareas and inputs based on its content. Since I could not remember its name and only found it by digging through my Mastodon conversations and finding this [post by Jen Simmons](https://mastodon.social/@jensimmons@front-end.social/111619407998095697) again, I thought I'd note it down here.

The property is called `field-sizing` and has two possible values: `strict` (default, just as before) and `content` which will automatically grow the element if needed.

The team at [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) did a great job explaining it in more detail in [this blog post: Field-sizing just works!](https://polypane.app/blog/field-sizing-just-works) â€“ go read it if you have not heard about it.
