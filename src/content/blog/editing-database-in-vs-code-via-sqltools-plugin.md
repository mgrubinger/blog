Lately I've been using the plugin [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) for VS Code for viewing and editing SQL databases.

It's easy to set up (don't forget to install the required drivers for your database engine, see the description of [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools)) and easy to use.

I have not yet figured out, why it sometimes would open the result of a query in a new editor pane. Besides that, I find it comfortable to be able to quickly view and edit the database right from my editor.

By the way, this extension also works if you're working on a remote environment via [VS Codes Remote-SSH tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
