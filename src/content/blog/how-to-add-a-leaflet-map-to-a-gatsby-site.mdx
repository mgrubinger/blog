I have been a long time user and fan of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), a popular mapping library by [@mourner](https://agafonkin.com/). Recently I needed to integrate a rather simple map (with about 20 markers) to a Gatsby site.

As it turns out, there's a wrapper for Leaflet in React out there: [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) (Some crazy naming right there, I know!). So I installed react-leaflet as a dependency and imported it, created a `<Map>`, `<TileLayer>` as well as a few `<Markers>` in my page component. Et voilÃ , we have a leaflet map up and showing up in my gatsby site in no time (running in *development* mode)!

I simply commited and pushed my changes, as always expecting Netlify to do the rest (i.e. building the site and deploying it). Only later that day I realized the builds were throwing an error: `window is not defined` ðŸ˜§

## The problem

Leaflet uses the `window` object internally. When trying to do SSR (server side rendering) as Gatsby does, there is no `window` (because the app is not acually loading in a brower environment). As a newcomer to React and SSR, this was new to me (although it makes sense).

So wherever I need use `window.` in my code, I have to add checks if `window` actually exists. This can be done easily in my application code. But, we're using an external library (Leaflet) here and the last thing I want to do is to mess with the library itself.

## The solution

After trying a few different approaches without success, I came across this page in the Gatsby docs: [Debugging HTML Builds](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/debugging-html-builds/#fixing-third-party-modules)

We can configure webpack to basically ignore certain modules for the build-stage. To do this, add this code to your `gatsby-node.js` file:

```javascript
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, loaders, actions }) => {
  if (stage === "build-html") {
    actions.setWebpackConfig({
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /leaflet/,
            use: loaders.null(),
          },
        ],
      },
    })
  }
}
```

That's it. Our Gatsby build works again! ðŸ™ƒ
