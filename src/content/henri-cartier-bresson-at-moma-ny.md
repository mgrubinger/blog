During my internship at <a href="https://secondstory.com">Second Story Interactive Studios</a> in Portland, Oregon I was honored to be part of the team to develop the website accompaning the exhibition <i>Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century</i> at the Museum of Modern Art NY.

Even though in spring of 2010 the term "responsive webdesign" was not yet a coined term, the site is built in a responsive manner. This was especially important as the website was also installed at a public kiosk at the museum.

Looking back I find it highly interesting that the result of the project was a static website. There was no Gatsby or Hugo back then, so we exported the php views from Symfony using a custom-built exporter.

## Awards
The project was awarded a [Best of the Web Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_the_Web_awards#2011) by Museums and the Web in 2011.
