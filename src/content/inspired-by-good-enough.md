I recently read about [Pika](https://pika.page/) blogging platform on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) and checked it out. Oh, nice looking website. Nice choice of fonts, clean layout, fantastic image with some unexpected, but relateable copy around Barry. I was intrigued.

Then, I even scrolled down all the way to the footer, where it says "Pika is [Good Enough](https://goodenough.us/), and so are you." – and followed that link. Look at that – more products, more links! Clicky clicky. I was delighted at what I saw.

> When was the last time you clicked around a company website, just because its design language appealed so much to you?

For me, it felt what browsing in the past felt like: just follow a bunch of links because you're curious where it might lead to.

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly it is that speaks to me, but the overall "look and feel" of those websites is just :100:

**So refreshing** – great work, [Good Enough](https://goodenough.us/)!

_Note: this is not an ad. I just want to praise the folks who built these websites in an era, where pretty much all websites look alike._
