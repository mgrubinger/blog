Autowuzzler is a virtual foosball (table soccer) multiplayer game. Invite your friends and shoot those goals.

Note: I shut it down after a few years. It was a nice experiment, I learned a ton, but did not want to maintain and pay for hosting/domain any further.

### Idea

During the first Covid-19 lockdown, I missed playing foosball with my colleagues at the Geizhals-office, so I decided to do something about it. While playing toy cars with my kid, I had the idea of mixing virtual toy cars with a foosball setup and combining it with a simple Join-via-PIN Ã  la [kahoot.it](http://kahoot.it) to enable frictionless sessions.

### Gameplay

The game resembles a 2D topdown view of a foosball table. Each player is assigned to one of two teams and tries to kick the ball into the correct goal. The first team reaching 10 goals wins.

### Joining a Game

To start a new game, a player creates a game PIN for a session. This game PIN can then be shared with friends as a unique URL to their game session. When a player first loads the game, they enter a nickname which will appear next to the players car.

### Tech-Stack

This application is built on the following stack:

- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) for the public app and frontend (autowuzzler.com)
- Colyseus.js as an authoritative real-time game server
- [Matter.js](https://www.brm.io/matter-js/) for physics calculations
- [Supabase.io](http://Supabase.io) to store game PINs
- Hosting
  - Linode for the Node-server
  - Netlify for the public-facing (frontend) application
