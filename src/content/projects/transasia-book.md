In spring 2016 I arrived back home from a 6-month+ motorcycle trip from Vienna, Austria to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (see project [28771 Kilometers](https://grooovinger.com/projects/28771-kilometers/)). I had a stack of SD-cards full of photos and a bag full of stories to tell. I decided to recompile the stories I wrote for the blog and a selection of the best photos into a beautiful book.

After months of photo editing, writing, layouting and designing I finally printed the book: Transasia â€“ Mit dem Motorrad von Meidling nach Malaysia. I'm pretty happy with the results.

Currently I only sell the book directly, so if you're interested please contact me: [martin.grubinger@gmail.com](mailto:martin.grubinger@gmail.com)
