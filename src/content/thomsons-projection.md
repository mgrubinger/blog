[Christopher Thomson](http://www.christopherthomson.net/), a talented writer, filmmaker and photographer, asked me to transform two of his hand-drawn maps into an interactive experience.

The two intriguing maps show the area around the village of Dordolla, Italy in an interesting perspective. One at daytime looking west, one at nighttime looking east. The maps show hiking paths, almost forgotten places and the peaks around the village.

The application enables users to explore the maps in all their beautiful detail. Every place on the map also has a photograph attached to it. This way you can get a sense of the beauty of the area even if you're far away.

This project was realized as part of the exhibition EWIGE BAUSTELLE in May 2014.
