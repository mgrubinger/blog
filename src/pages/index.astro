      <p>Welcome to my personal website, my blog, my <em>digital garden</em>&nbsp;ü™¥.</p>
      <p>
        This is where I write about <a href="/notes">what I've learned</a> and show
        off
        <a href="/projects">projects</a> I worked on. This is also where I want to
        be found on the web. I aim to <i>cultivate</i>
        this site as is grows, write more, improve it, experiment and try out new
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am a Lead Front-end Developer at
        <a href="https://geizhals.at/" target="_blank">Geizhals.at</a> (since February
        2020). From 2013‚Äì2020 I was a Technology Director at
        <a href="https://fluxguide.com/" target="_blank">Fluxguide</a> in Vienna.
        I also tought a course on front-end web development at <a
          href="https://www.fhstp.ac.at/de"
          target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences St. P√∂lten</a
        > from 2019‚Äì2021.

      <p>
        From 2007-2012 I studied Digital Media Technologies at St. P√∂lten
        University of Applied Sciences. In 2010 I had the amazing opportunity to
        do an internship at Second Story Interactive Studios (sadly
        discontinued) in Portland, Oregon. Besides my main job I love working on
        side projects to try out new tools. Some of those you can see in the <a
          href="/projects">projects</a
        >
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015/16 I traveled from Vienna, Austria to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia by
        motorcycle. I self-published <a href="/projects/transasia-book"
          >a book about the trip</a
        >, and did a couple of slideshow presentations in Austria and Canada.

        Married üíç to a wonderful woman. Dad of 2 amazing kids (age 3 and 7) üõù.
