    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Hi, I'm Martin Grubinger,<br>builder of web-things.</h1>
</div>

  Welcome to my website, my blog, my _digital garden_.

  This is where I write about [what I've learned](/blog) and show off [projects](/projects) I worked on.
  This is also where I want to be found on the web, my public _business card_ in a way. I aim to _cultivate_ this site as is grows, write more, improve it, experiment and try out new things.

    Currently I am a Lead Front-end Developer at [Geizhals.at](https://geizhals.at/) (since February 2020). From
    2013‚Äì2020 I was a Technology Director at [Fluxguide](https://fluxguide.com/) in Vienna. I also tought a
    course on front-end web development at [University of Applied Sciences St.
    P√∂lten](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/de) from 2019‚Äì2021.

    From 2007-2012 I studied Digital Media Technologies at St. P√∂lten University of Applied Sciences.
    In 2010 I had the amazing opportunity to do an internship at [Second Story Interactive
    Studios](https://www.razorfish.com/second-story/) in Portland, Oregon. Besides my main job I love
    working on side projects to try out new tools. Many of those projects you can see in the
    [Projects](/projects) section.

    In 2015/16 I traveled from Vienna, Austria to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia by motorcycle. You can read
    more about my adventure on my [blog](http://transasia.mgrubinger.at/) (German only) or [buy my
    book](http://transasia.mgrubinger.at/transasia-das-buch/).

    Married üíç, dad√ó2.

    Trivia: I am frequently mistaken
    for [Martin Grubinger](https://www.martingrubinger.com/) (I don't blame you).
